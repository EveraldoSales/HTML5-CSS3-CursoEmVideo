Tales of the Giant Penguin Sea Monster are fanciful and often misleading, painting images of at towering, thunderous beast splitting the hulls of wooden sailing ships, flooding coastal towns in the frozen wash of the sea, and downing great whales as a smaller penguin might swallow a fish. In truth, the Giant Penguin Sea Monster is seldom taller than seven feet, and its most potent weapons are a devastatingly cute wiggle of its great tail, the allure of its tummy-swirl, and the warmest hugs known to icy waters. Rumors of Giant Penguin Sea Monsters frequenting urban brothels are no doubt slander meant to titillate readers of disreputable gossip magazines.
